# Training YOLOv8
We train using Ultralytics' YOLOv8 package, so refer to the [Ultralytics documentation(https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/) for formatting your data to train custom YOLOv8 object detection models. When exporting labeled data from Label-Studio, choosing the `YOLO` format will automatically generate label text files that are compatible for YOLOv8.
